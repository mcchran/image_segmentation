Provided an Xray image lung area could be exported.
The deployed strategy is a UNET based achitecture invoking dense layers to provide more robust results.

Hint: Every machine learning project does messy structured directories. In this context this is one of my first experimets to provide a lean organization layout that should work for any other ML task ...
